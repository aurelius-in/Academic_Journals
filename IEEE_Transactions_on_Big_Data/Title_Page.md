## Abstract
Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity today. The impact of climate change is already being felt around the world in the form of rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and more frequent natural disasters. In this paper, we propose to use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to accurately predict weather patterns and model the impact of climate change. By leveraging the power of distributed computing, we can process large datasets in real-time and provide accurate forecasts and predictions that can help communities and governments make informed decisions. We present a distributed big data processing framework that uses AI/ML algorithms to accurately predict weather patterns and model the impact of climate change. We train deep learning and reinforcement learning models on massive datasets of historical climate data to generate accurate predictions that are not possible with traditional forecasting methods. We integrate data from various sources, including weather sensors, satellite imagery, and social media platforms, to create a comprehensive view of the climate and develop more accurate models. We provide actionable insights that can help communities and governments make informed decisions about how to prepare for and respond to extreme weather events and reduce their impact on people and the environment.
